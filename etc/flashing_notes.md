Note: without the `-bl dfu` parameter, nothing bad happens, it just waiting for the controller and can not find it.

Note: to reset the controller without the reset button, use RST and GND pins (there are two near each other on one side), connect them with tweezers.

## Flashing Pro Micro

New one, not flashed before - flashing whent on immediately, no reset was needed:

On the next flash, the RST+GND reset was needed (as expected).
